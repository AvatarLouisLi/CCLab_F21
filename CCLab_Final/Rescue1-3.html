    <p class="a1">One day, a pregnant woman who was nine months pregnant was taken to the hospital</p>
    <p class="a2">She was shelled and seriously injured</p>
    <p class="a3">The doctor reminds you that it is very unlikely that both mother and child can survive</p>
    <p class="a4">But since the hospital was built, you have witnessed too many deaths every day</p>
    <p class="a5">You swear to Allah: You will drive death away from your eyes</p>
    <p class="a6">You beg the doctor: In any case, do your best to save the lives of both mother and son</p>
    <p class="a7">The doctor pointed to the sky: Allah bless us</p>
